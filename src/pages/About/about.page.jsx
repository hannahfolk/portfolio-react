                  ðŸ‘‹ I'm Hannah Folk. I'm a full stack web developer based in
                  Los Angeles, CA. My favorite technologies to code in are
                  React, MySQL, and Javascript. Currently I work for Hearful Hub
                  as a Junior Backend Engineer and Trilogy Education as a Senior
                  Tutor in Full Stack Web Development.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When I was in high school, I took AP Computer Science and
                  completely failed it. I was so discouraged from doing anything
                  computer science related, and so I turned to Math, Econ, and
                  Theatre at UC San Diego. But I did still have to take one
                  computer science course for a GE, Introduction to Programming:
                  Java. Something must have clicked back in high school because
                  that class was a breeze. From there, I wanted to be a CS
                  minor, but I could not fit it into my schedule in four years.
                  I tried self-studying throughout the years as well, but I
                  never had the time or the motivation to sit down and commit.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  So when I graduated and moved to Los Angeles, I decided to do
                  the UCLA Extension Coding Bootcamp, and it was the best
                  decision I've ever made in my life.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  When I'm not coding (or quarantined), I train at a parkour
                  gym, practice Kung Fu, and sing my heart out to a myriad of
                  Disney songs. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
